the connection of the circuit as follow : 

In H bridge motor driver 

connect the vcc1 with pin 1,2 EN and vcc2 with pin 3,4 EN .
Then connect them together 
Connect the ground pins together in each side then connect the both sides together .
Connect the the terminal 1 in the first dc motor with the output 4 pin in L298D 
Connect the the terminal 2 in the first dc motor with the output 3 pin in L298D 
Connect the the terminal 2 in the second dc motor with the output 1 pin in L298D 
Connect the the terminal 1 in the second dc motor with the output 2 pin in L298D  . 

In Arduino uno  
The 5v pin to pin 1,2 EN of L298D
The GND pin to GND of L298D
Pin 6 to input 4 pin of L298D
Pin 5 to input 3 pin of L298D
Pin 4 to input 1 pin of L298D
Pin 3 to input 2 pin of L298D

The battery 
The positive to vcc2 of L298D
The negative to GND of L298D
